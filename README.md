# dynamic-nav-practice
Dynamic navbar practice - playing with code.
Did not separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files. Everything is in one file.

## About

I am learning how to create a navbar dynamically using JavaScript for Front End Web Development on Udacity. However, I am finding this to be challenging. I searched the web for additional examples, that might demonstrate this more clearly.

## Process

While watching this YouTube Video [Web Designing- lab javascript dynamic navbar](https://youtu.be/rSHJa1Mji_I), I recreated the code to see how they did it. I am calling this the "original" file.

Next, I created a copy of the original file, and am using this file to play with the code and see what works/doesn't work.

## Changes Made

CSS - made boxes laid out more clearly, and adjusted colors to see what is really going on.

JavaScript - Created a copy of the first navbar, and made a 2nd navbar to go underneath it.

### Original Navbar
